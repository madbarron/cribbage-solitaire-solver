# Cribbage Solitaire Solver
Solver for the solitaire cribbage-like minigame from Zachtronics' Mobius Front '83

This is a fun little project that involves trying to cram the state of the game into 64 bits.

## Environment
- Visual Studio 2019
- C#
- .NET 3.1

## Usage
Run the program and enter each card in the game, one column at a time, from top to bottom.

Sit back and relax as the moves are analyzed, then follow the instructions. The program will pause after each hand and look farther into the future. Press enter when you see "..." to reveal the moves for the next hand.
